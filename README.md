# Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI)
Satellite-based monitoring of dry and wet condition using SPI

This analysis is following the training conducted in 28 Jan 2020 by [NASA ARSET](https://arset.gsfc.nasa.gov) on **Application of GPM Reanalysis for Assessing Extreme Dry and Wet Periods**. Link: https://arset.gsfc.nasa.gov/water/webinars/IMERG-2020

Some of the step have been modified and adjusted based on experiencing of several problems during the training, and latest version of [Climate Indices in Python](https://github.com/monocongo/climate_indices) software is used in this tutorial. While NASA ARSET training still used the official release version from [U.S. Drought Portal](https://www.drought.gov/drought/python-climate-indices)
